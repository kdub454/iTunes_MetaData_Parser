# In order to run this program correctly, input files must have the following naming convention
# {show Name} - S{01}E{04} 								-> The "series id" must contain all 6 characters to work correctly
# and you should have this have this package installed  ->  https://github.com/dbr/tvdb_api 

# Useful packages:
# https://github.com/dbr/tvnamer --> Renames files to meet the previously mentioned criteria
# https://github.com/dbr/tvdb_api --> Gives this program access to the tvdb api
 
# Before running this program, you will aslo need to have a folder that contains .jpg images you want 
# the album artwork to be set to. The pictures should follow this naming convention {show name}.jpg
